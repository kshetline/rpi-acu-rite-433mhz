# rpi-acu-rite-temperature

## Library for reading the Acu-Rite 06002M Wireless Temperature and Humidity Sensor using a Raspberry Pi with a 433Mhz receiver

_Note: This software is neither produced by nor endorsed by [Acu-Rite](https://acu-rite.com/site/). The author of this library is not associated with Acu-Rite or its products in any way, apart from finding their [433 MHz remote humidity/temperature sensors](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00T0K8NXC/) useful for this kind of project._

_This library was inspired by work originally done by [Ray Wang](http://rayshobby.net/?p=8998)._

`rpi-acu-rite-temperature` can be used for JavaScript/TypeScript programming in a Node.js environment, or the included C++ code can be used directly. It is the JavaScript/TypeScript interface that is documented here.

Full functionality requires a Raspberry Pi, but this code can be installed and compiled under MacOS (and perhaps Windows as well â€” not yet verified) in such a way that it returns simulated data for testing and development use.

### Installation

`npm install rpi-acu-rite-temperature`

### Usage

`const { addSensorDataListener, removeSensorDataListener } = require('rpi-acu-rite-temperature');`

_...or..._

`import { addSensorDataListener, PinSystem, removeSensorDataListener } from 'rpi-acu-rite-temperature';`

### HtSensorData

The format of the data returned by this library:

```typescript
export interface HtSensorData {
  batteryLow: boolean;
  channel: string;       // A, B, or C
  humidity: number;      // Integer 0-100
  miscData1: number;     // Bits  2-15 of the transmission.
  miscData2: number;     // Bits 17-23 of the transmission.
  miscData3: number;     // Bits 33-35 of the transmission.
  rawTemp: number;       // Integer tenths of a degree Celsius plus 1000 (original transmission data format)
  signalQuality: number; // Integer 0-100
  tempCelsius: number;
  tempFahrenheit: number;
  validChecksum: boolean; // Is the data fully trustworthy?
}
```

`signalQuality` is measured over a five minute window, and will register low even for a strong signal until a full five minutes have passed.

While it's best for `validChecksum` to be `true`, any data returned has also be validated by three parity bits. If you aren't willing to accept data from a weak signal that didn't arrive with a valid checksum, you might have to wait a long time for any data at all.

### addSensorDataListener

This function is used to register a callback that receives the above temperature/humidity data. You must specify the input `pin` to which your 433 MHz RF receiver is connected, and optionally specify a pin numbering system. The default is `PinSystem.VIRTUAL`, which is the default pin numbering system used by _WiringPi_. Optionally you may use:

* `PinSystem.SYS`: _/sys/class/gpio_ interface pin numbers.
* `PinSystem.GPIO`: Broadcom GPIO pin numbers.
* `PinSystem.PHYS`: physical pin numbers on the P1 connector.

_For more information see: http://wiringpi.com/reference/setup/_

```
addSensorDataListener(pin: number, callback: HtSensorDataCallback): number;
addSensorDataListener(pin: number, pinSystem: PinSystem, callback: HtSensorDataCallback): number;
```

The function returns a numeric ID which can be used by the function below to unregister your callback.

### removeSensorDataListener

```
function removeSensorDataListener(callbackId: number): void;
```
